# EMGaussianMixtureModel
This is the Java implementation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit maximum likelihood parameters for a Gaussian Mixture Model.

# TODO
1) Testing for everything
2) Implement E step for 1 dimension GMM
3) Implement M step for 1 dimension GMM
4) tons of other stuff I'm probably forgetting for 1d GMM
